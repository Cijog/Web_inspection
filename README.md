# Cybersecurity: Suspicious Web Threat Interactions
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing suspicious or potentially harmful activities in web traffic using a cybersecurity dataset. It begins by loading and exploring the cybersecurity_data.csv file to understand its structure, followed by cleaning the data by handling missing values and formatting timestamps. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase includes experimenting with a Random Forest Classifier to establish a baseline for identifying threats, alongside preparing data for a Neural Network by scaling features. The Neural Network, built with a Convolutional layer, Dense layers, and Dropout, is trained over 10 epochs to classify traffic, achieving 100% accuracy on test data. Visualization tracks accuracy trends, while additional monitoring and documentation ensure reproducibility. This approach leverages both tree-based and deep learning techniques to enhance threat detection.
